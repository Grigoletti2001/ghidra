***This Fork is for the French language translation of Ghidra*** We will consider it unofficial at the moment. Send me a message and I can invite you to the crowdin Project I set up for this. 

Bonjour à tous, 
Ce dépôt GIT existe pour la traduction du project Ghidra (un outil crée par le NSA <<Agence nationale de la sécurité>>) en langue française.

Si vous voulez contribuer à la traduction, veuillez m'envoyer un message privé via GitHub ou par courriel (grigoletti at icloud dot com) et je peux vous ajouter au project Crowdin ou ( vous pouvez allez ou projet directement

https://crowdin.com/project/ghidra-fr/invite?d=q64566k675f507b373l4r493o4  )

et créez un compte. Après cela, vous pouvez commencer la traduction. SVP, il faut prioritiser la traduction du project avant on commence avec le QA. Cela va arrive après la première version française.

# Ghidra Software Reverse Engineering Framework

Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the [National Security Agency][nsa] Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of process instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python.

In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems.

This repository is a placeholder for the full open source release.
Be assured efforts are under way to make the software available here.
In the meantime, enjoy using Ghidra on your SRE efforts, developing your
own scripts and plugins, and perusing the over-one-million-lines of Java and
Sleigh code released within the initial public release.
The release can be downloaded from our [project homepage][project].
Please consider taking a look at our [contributor guide][contrib] to see how
you can participate in this open source project when it becomes available.

If you are interested in projects like this and would like to develop this, and
other cybersecurity tools, for NSA to help protect our nation and its allies,
